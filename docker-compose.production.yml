# Production deployment is managed by compose-up.sh using the
# per-service compose files in compose/.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/compose-up.sh up       # Start all services
#   ./scripts/compose-up.sh down     # Stop all services
#   ./scripts/compose-up.sh restart xmpp   # Restart just Prosody
#   ./scripts/compose-up.sh status   # Check service health
#
# Each service has its own compose file in compose/{db,idp,xmpp,proxy}/
# with isolated networks and each service runs independently. 
#
# For local development, use docker-compose.non-prod.yml instead.
